This guide helps you customize your Oracle system. Answer these questions, then use an AI assistant to populate your files.

## Step 1: Tell Your Story

Copy this prompt and paste it into Amazon Q, Claude, or ChatGPT along with your answers:

```
I'm setting up the Oracle AI Advisory System. Here's my information:

**WHO I AM:**
- Name: [Your name]
- Role/Expertise: [What you do]
- Key capabilities: [What you're good at]
- Current position: [Where you are professionally]
- Core philosophy: [Your values/principles]

**VALIDATION (quotes from clients/colleagues):**
- Quote 1: [Client/colleague feedback]
- Quote 2: [Client/colleague feedback]
- Quote 3: [Client/colleague feedback]

**MY PATTERNS (be honest):**
- Pattern 1: [e.g., "Over-delivery without closure"]
- Pattern 2: [e.g., "Marketing resistance"]
- Pattern 3: [e.g., "Retreat to building when stressed"]
- Pattern 4: [e.g., "Red flag blindness"]
- Pattern 5: [e.g., "Hypervigilance from past trauma"]

**WHERE I AM NOW:**
- Financial buffer: [Amount]
- Monthly recurring income: [Amount]
- Monthly expenses: [Amount]
- Runway: [Time until cash runs out]
- Debt: [Amount and payment plan]
- Key operational status: [What's working/not working]
- Key relationships: [Clients, partners, status]

**MY CHALLENGES:**
1. [Challenge 1]
2. [Challenge 2]
3. [Challenge 3]
4. [Challenge 4]
5. [Challenge 5]

**WHAT I NEED:**
- Career goal: [Where you want to be]
- Income target: [Month 1, Month 3, Year 1]
- Key accountability question: [The ONE question that matters most]

Please help me populate the Oracle template files:
1. README.md (WHO/WHERE/WHY/HOW/WHEN sections)
2. advisors/CareersAdvisor.md
3. advisors/FinancialAdvisor.md
4. advisors/LegalAdvisor.md
5. advisors/MarketingAdvisor.md
6. advisors/Psychologist.md

Use the template structure already in the files, just fill in my specific information.
```

---

## Step 2: Let AI Populate Your Files

Once you've provided your information:

1. **Ask AI to update README.md first**
   - "Update the README.md WHO section with my information"
   - "Update the WHERE section with my financial status"
   - "Update the WHY section with my challenges"

2. **Then populate each advisor file**
   - "Now update advisors/CareersAdvisor.md with my career information"
   - "Update advisors/FinancialAdvisor.md with my financial details"
   - Continue for all 5 advisors

3. **Review and refine**
   - Read what AI generated
   - Ask for adjustments: "Make the CareersAdvisor more aggressive about pricing"
   - Iterate until it feels right

## Step 3: Add Evidence

Create files in these folders:

**projects/** - Your case studies
- One file per major project
- Include: client, challenge, solution, results, validation

**clients/** - Your relationships
- One file per client
- Include: status, payment history, green/red flags

**finances/** - Your tracking
- Current_Status.md - Real-time snapshot
- Monthly_Tracking.md - Income/expenses
- Debt_Management.md - Payment plans

**skills/** - Your capabilities
- Resume.md - Full resume
- Technical_Skills.md - Detailed capabilities
- Publications.md - Papers, articles

**background/** - Your context
- Personal_History.md - Key experiences
- Pattern_Analysis.md - Deep dive into patterns
- Philosophy.md - Core values

---

## Step 4: Activate Your Oracle

1. **Pin README.md in your AI chat**
   - Amazon Q: Use @file to reference README.md
   - Claude/ChatGPT: Copy README.md into conversation

2. **Ask: "What do you need from the Oracle?"**

3. **Use it for decisions:**
   - "Should I take this client?"
   - "What should I focus on this week?"
   - "Am I in retreat-to-building mode?"

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Don't have time for full setup? Start minimal:

1. **Fill in README.md WHO section** (your identity, patterns)
2. **Fill in WHERE section** (financial status, runway)
3. **Write ONE accountability question** (the question that matters most)
4. **Pin it in AI chat**
5. **Ask: "What should I do this week?"**

You can add advisor files and evidence folders later.

---

## Tips

**Be brutally honest about patterns:**
The Oracle only works if you're honest. Don't hide the embarrassing stuff.

**Update when facts change:**
Payment received? Update finances. Client lost? Update clients. Pattern recognized? Update background.

**Trust the consensus:**
When all 5 advisors agree, that's your signal.

**Start simple, add complexity:**
You don't need everything filled in to start. Begin with basics, add detail over time.

## Example Prompts for AI

**Initial setup:**
- "Help me set up my Oracle system with this information: [paste your answers]"

**Daily use:**
- "What do you need from the Oracle?"
- "Should I take this client? Here's the situation: [details]"
- "What should I focus on this week?"
- "Am I in retreat-to-building mode?"

**Pattern recognition:**
- "Pattern check: I want to build a new platform instead of doing outreach"
- "Red flag check: Client wants to start work before signing contract"

**Accountability:**
- "Did I send 20 outreach emails?" (or whatever your key question is)
- "Weekly check-in: What did I commit to? What did I actually do?"

## Need Help?

The Oracle is designed to work WITH AI assistants. If you're stuck:

1. **Ask AI to help you set it up:** "I'm setting up the Oracle template. Can you help me fill in the WHO section?"

2. **Show AI the template files:** Use @file references or copy/paste the template structure

3. **Iterate:** AI will help you refine until it feels right

The system gets better as you use it. Start simple, add complexity over time.
